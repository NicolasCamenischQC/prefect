# Deployments

A deployment is a server-side concept that encapsulates a flow, allowing it to be scheduled and triggered via API. 

Deployments are uniquely identified by the combination of flow_name/deployment_name. Each deployment is associated with a single flow. The deployment stores metadata about where your flow's code is stored and how your flow should be run.

For detailed information about deployment objects, see the [prefect.deployments](/api-ref/prefect/deployments/) API documentation.

## Deployments overview

In Orion, all flow runs are tracked by the API. The API does not require prior registration of flows. With Orion, you can call a flow locally or on a remote environment and it will be tracked. Deployments are, however, necessary for scheduling flow runs.

Deployments persist your flow to a location or tell the server about the location to which a flow has been persisted so the server can schedule and execute flow runs for you. 

At a high level, you can think of a deployment as configuration for managing flows, whether you run them via the CLI, UI, or the API.

More specifically:

- A _deployment_ is the object stored by the API after you register a _deployment specification_. 
- A [deployment specification](#deployment-specifications) includes the settings that will be used to create the deployment. 
- Running a deployment creates a flow run using the settings defined in the deployment object.

For example, in the Orion server, the deployment object has a `flow_data` field, which is a [`DataDocument`](/api-ref/orion/schemas/data/#prefect.orion.schemas.data.DataDocument) that tells the server how to access the flow. This may be a document containing:

- A pointer to a file that contains the flow
- The literal text of the flow code
- A pickled version of the flow

With a deployment specification, you just provide the path to the flow script. When you create a deployment based on the deployment specification, client-side utilities take care of constructing the deployment for you, including additional details such as the `flow_data` document. 

### Deployments and flows

Each deployment is associated with a single flow, but any given flow can have multiple deployments. This enables you to run a single flow with different parameters, on multiple schedules, and in different environments. This also allows you to run different versions of the same flow for testing and promotion purposes.

Flow runners enable you to dynamically allocate infrastructure for your flow runs. Since the flow's code must be retrieved on the created infrastructure, configuring flow runners is possible only for deployed flows.

A simple example of a deployment specification for a flow looks like this:

```python
from prefect.deployments import DeploymentSpec

DeploymentSpec(
    flow_location="flow.py",
    name="flow-deployment", 
)
```

Once the deployment has been created, you'll see it in the Orion dashboard and can inspect it using the CLI.

When you run a deployed flow in Orion, the following happens:

- The user runs the deployment, which creates a flow run. (The API creates flow runs automatically for deployments with schedules.)
- An agent detects the flow run and uses a flow runner to create infrastructure for the run.
- The flow run executes within the infrastructure.

## Deployment representation in Orion

In Orion, a deployment is an instance of the Prefect [`Deployment`](/api-ref/orion/schemas/core/#prefect.orion.schemas.core.Deployment) object. When you create a deployment, it is constructed from deployment specification data you provide and additional properties calculated by client-side utilities.

Deployment properties include:

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| id | An auto-generated UUID ID value identifying the deployment. |
| created | A `datetime` timestamp indicating when the deployment was created. |
| updated | A `datetime` timestamp indicating when the deployment was last changed. |
| name | The name of the deployment. |
| flow_id | The id of the flow associated with the deployment. |
| flow_data | A [`DataDocument`](/api-ref/orion/schemas/data/#prefect.orion.schemas.data.DataDocument) representing the flow code to execute. |
| schedule | An optional schedule for the deployment. |
| is_schedule_active | Boolean indicating whether the deployment schedule is active. Default is True. |
| parameters | An optional dictionary of parameters for flow runs scheduled by the deployment. |
| tags | An optional list of tags for the deployment. |
| flow_runner | [`FlowRunnerSettings`](/api-ref/orion/schemas/core/#prefect.orion.schemas.core.FlowRunnerSettings) containing details about the flow runner to assign to flow runs associated with this deployment. |

You can inspect a deployment using the CLI with the `prefect deployment inspect` command, referencing the deployment with `<flow_name>/<deployment_name>`.

```bash 
$ prefect deployment inspect hello-world/hello-world-daily
Deployment(
    id='fee2bf95-5022-4945-bd7a-42a67b8b25fb',
    created='39 minutes ago',
    updated='39 minutes ago',
    name='hello-world-daily',
    flow_id='118a3548-e74b-4555-9bac-fe52d81e536f',
    flow_data=DataDocument(encoding='orion'),
    schedule=IntervalSchedule(interval=datetime.timedelta(seconds=60), 
                              anchor_date='2 years ago'),
    parameters={'name': 'Marvin'},
    tags=['foo', 'bar'],
    flow_runner=FlowRunnerSettings()
)
```

The [prefect.orion.api.deployments](/api-ref/orion/api/deployments/) API also provides functions for inspecting deployments by id or name.

## Deployment specifications

To create a deployment in Orion, you do not have to specify _all_ of the Deployment object properties. A _deployment specification_ lets you provide the details relevant to deploying your flow. When you create a deployment from a deployment specification, Orion uses the settings provided by your specification, defaults, and automatically constructed data such as timestamps and ids to create the underlying deployment object.

There are several ways to build a deployment specification and use it to create a deployment:

- If calling the API manually, construct a request with the fields specified by [`DeploymentCreate`](/api-ref/orion/schemas/actions/#prefect.orion.schemas.actions.DeploymentCreate).
- If using the `OrionClient`, the request will be constructed for you. See [`OrionClient.create_deployment`](/api-ref/prefect/client/#prefect.client.OrionClient.create_deployment) for the required fields.
- You can also write your deployment specification as Python or YAML and use the CLI to create the deployment. The CLI will generate the `DeploymentCreate` object to pass to the API.

### DeploymentSpec object

You can create a [`DeploymentSpec`](/api-ref/prefect/deployments/#prefect.deployments.DeploymentSpec) object in your application and pass that to Orion to create a deployment.

A `DeploymentSpec` object has the following required parameters:

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| name | String specifying the name of the deployment. |
| flow | The flow object to associate with the deployment. |
| flow_name | String specifying the name of the flow to deploy. |
| flow_location | String specifying the path to a script containing the flow to deploy. Inferred from `flow` if provided. |
| push_to_server | Boolean indicating whether the flow text will be loaded from the flow location and stored on the server instead of locally. This allows the flow to be compatible with all flow runners. If False, only an agent on the same machine will be able to run the deployment. Default is True. |
| parameters | Dictionary of default parameters to set on flow runs from this deployment. If defined in Python, the values should be Pydantic-compatible objects. |
| schedule | [Schedule](/concepts/schedules/) instance specifying a schedule for running the deployment. |
| tags | List containing tags to assign to the deployment. |

Either the flow object or location must be provided.

If a flow location is provided, the script at the given location will be run when the deployment is created to load metadata about the flow.

## Deployment specifications as code

You can also define a [`DeploymentSpec`](/api-ref/prefect/deployments/#prefect.deployments.DeploymentSpec) object as either Python or YAML code. You can create deployment specifications of this type in two ways:

- In a Python script, setting `flow` to the flow object. The flow object can be from the same file or imported.
- In a Python or YAML file, setting `flow_location` to the path of the Python script containing the flow object.

In the second case, if there are multiple flows in the `flow_location`, you will need to also pass a `flow_name` to disambiguate.

If you define the `DeploymentSpec` within the file that contains the flow, you only need to specify the flow function and the deployment name. Other parameters are optional and are inferred or constructed by Orion utilities when you create a deployment.

```Python
from prefect import flow

@flow
def hello_world(name="world"):
    print(f"Hello {name}!")

# Note: a deployed flow does not need a command to 
# explicitly run the flow. The API handles this for you.
# hello_world()

from prefect.deployments import DeploymentSpec

DeploymentSpec(
    flow=hello_world,
    name="hello-world-daily",
)
```

If you define the `DeploymentSpec` in a separate Python deployment file, specify the path and filename of the file containing the flow definition, along with the deployment name. Other parameters are optional in the deployment specification.

```Python
from prefect.deployments import DeploymentSpec

DeploymentSpec(
    flow_location="/path/to/flow.py",
    name="hello-world-daily", 
)
```

Deployment specifications can also be written in YAML and refer to the flow's location instead of the flow object:

```yaml
name: hello-world-daily
flow_location: ./path/to/flow.py
flow_name: hello-world
tags:
- foo
- bar
parameters:
    name: "Earth"
schedule:
    interval: 3600
```

A deployment specification file or flow definition may include multiple deployment specifications, each representing settings for a different deployment for a flow. Each deployment specification for a given flow must have a unique name &mdash; Orion does not support duplicate instances of flow_name/deployment_name. You can, however, include deployment specifications for multiple different flows in a single deployment file.

!!! note "Writing multiple specifications in a single file"
    Multiple deployment specifications can be defined in a single file by using the `---` YAML document separator.

    For example:

    ```yaml
    name: first-deployment
    flow_location: ./path/to/first/flow.py
    ---
    name: second-deployment
    flow_location: ./path/to/second/flow.py
    ```

## Creating deployments 

Creating a deployment is the process of providing deployment specification data to Orion, which then creates the deployment object for the associated flow. If the deployment includes a schedule, Orion then immediately creates the schedule flow runs and begins running the scheduled flows.

There are several ways to create an Orion deployment:

- Using CLI commands and a Python or YAML [`DeploymentSpec`](/api-ref/prefect/deployments/#prefect.deployments.DeploymentSpec).
- Using [OrionClient](/api-ref/prefect/client/#prefect.client.OrionClient) to create a deployment with [`create_deployment`](/api-ref/prefect/client/#prefect.client.OrionClient.create_deployment). 
- Making an API call with a JSON document conforming to `DeploymentCreate`. (Not recommended at this time.)

### Creating deployments with the CLI

Create a deployment with the Prefect CLI using the `prefect deployment create` command, specifying the name of the file containing the deployment specification. 

You can also run `prefect deployment create` to update an existing deployment:

```bash
$ prefect deployment create <filename>
```

For example, if the hello-world deployment specification shown earlier is in the file flow.py, you'd see something like the following:

```bash
$ prefect deployment create flow.py
Loading deployments from python script at 'flow.py'...
Created deployment 'hello-world-daily' for flow 'hello-world'
```

!!! note "Scheduled flow runs"

    Scheduled flow runs will not be created unless the scheduler is running. Scheduled flow runs will not run unless an agent is running. The scheduler and agent are included in the services started by `prefect orion start`. 

### Creating deployments with the API

Coming soon.

## Running deployments

If you specify a schedule for a deployment, the deployment will execute its flow automatically on that schedule as long as the Orion API server and agent is running.

In the Orion dashboard, you can click the **Quick Run** button next to any deployment to execute an ad hoc flow run for that deployment.

The `prefect deployment` CLI command provides commands for managing and running deployments locally.

| Command | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| create | Create or update a deployment from a file. |
| run | Create a flow run for the given flow and deployment. |
| execute | Execute a local flow run for a given deployment. Does not require an agent and bypasses flow runner settings attached to the deployment. Intended for testing purposes. |
| inspect | View details about a deployment. |
| ls | View all deployments or deployments for specific flows. |

### Running deployments with the API

Coming soon.

## Examples

The following example builds on an earlier example, demonstrating the use of multiple deployment specifications for a single flow, along with deployment-specific parameters and tags.

```Python
from prefect import flow

@flow
def hello_world(name="world"):
    print(f"Hello {name}!")

from prefect.deployments import DeploymentSpec
from prefect.orion.schemas.schedules import IntervalSchedule
from datetime import timedelta

DeploymentSpec(
    flow=hello_world,
    name="hello-world-daily",
    schedule=IntervalSchedule(interval=timedelta(days=1)),
    tags=["earth"],
)

DeploymentSpec(
    flow=hello_world,
    name="hello-orion",
    schedule=IntervalSchedule(interval=timedelta(weeks=1)),
    parameters={"name": "Orion"},
    tags=["marvin"],
)
```
